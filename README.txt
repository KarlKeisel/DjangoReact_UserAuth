DjangoReact UserAuth:

These two apps will work together to provide a full stack user creation and login system.

Using Django for the backend I use the RestAPI framework to allow my custom Users model to be modified from the React frontend app that will have a nice polished look. I like to think of this as the standard 'To-Do' list but upgraded.
